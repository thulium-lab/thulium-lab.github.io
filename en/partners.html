            Avesta LTD develops and manufactures femtosecond laser oscillators
            and amplifiers (both solid-state and fiber-based) as well as ultrafast
            diagnostic tools and various laser components.

            Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology (Skoltech) is involved
            in many collaborations with leading research centers in the field of
            optical frequency standards, including Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt
            (PTB), Braunschweig, Germany. An original concept of optical frequency
            standard based on  single ytterbium ions was developed in the
            laboratory of time and freqeuncy measuring problems.

            Institute of Laser Physics of the Siberian branch of the Russian
            Academy of Sciences is one of the leading research centers in the
            field of optical frequency standards. There are several projects for
            creating optical frequency standards currently under way (based on
            neutral magnesium and ytterbium ion, relative instability is expected
            to be around 10<sup>-17</sup> &mdash; 10<sup>-18</sup>).
