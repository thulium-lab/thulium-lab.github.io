      <h1>Topic</h1>
      <p>
        Development of ultra stable frequency reference signals generator
        based on cold ytterbium ions, aimed at a significant increase of the accuracy of
        geopositioning, space navigation, and introducing new applications of global
        navigational satellites systems.

      <h1>Idea</h1>
      <p>
        Development of transportable optical frequency standard with daily instability
        not less than 5&sdot;10<sup>-16</sup> for the new generation of GLONASS'
        on-board synchronisation devices, thus enhancing the precision of geopositioning
        down to 20 cm and allowing new applications of global navigational
        satellites systems.

    <div class="section">
      <h1>Expected results</h1>
      <p>
        Development and testing modules for optical frequency standard and its
        integration into the experimental setup of on-board frequency reference.

        This should decrease the size and improve operational properties of frequency
        standards, and could be later used to refine the following applications:
        synchronisation systems, detecting and controlling air, ground and underwater
        transport systems, remote sensing systems, on-board frequency standard.
