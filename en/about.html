            The P.N.Lebedev Physical Institute of Russian Academy of Science is
            taking one of the leading positions in the field of optical frequency
            standards in Russia. The Institute develops optical frequency standards
            based on thulium atoms, aluminium and magnesium ions, and also highly
            stable cryogenic silicon resonators. Employees at the institute
            have a vast experience in precision spectroscopy and are proficient
            at working with key elements of optical frequency standards, such as
            traps for neutral atoms and ions, laser cooling systems, and highly stable
            laser systems. They have also made a number of highly stable laser
            systems stabilized by external high-quality vibration-compensated
            resonators.
