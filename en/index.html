      <h1>Overview</h1>
      <p>
        In order to promote scientific and industrial complex of Russia,
        Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation has supported
        the development of transportable optical clocks: project "YBIS"
      </p>
      <p>
        Project "YBIS" started in October 2017 when leading research centres of Russia
        have joined their forces: LPI RAS (Moscow), Institute of Laser Physics
        (Novosibirsk), Skoltech (Moscow), Avesta (Moscow).
        JSC "Russian Space Systems" is the industrial partner.
      </p>
      <p>
        "YBIS" is to bring huge potential of quantum technology being developed all
        over the world to our everyday life and practical use. It includes but
        not limited to: Satellite navigation, deep space exploration, measuring
        the change of the world Ocean level and Earth crust displacement.

            Current global navigational satellite systems have the precision of
            about 1 m. Increasing this precision would require the improvement of
            these systems' key elements &mdash; ground and on-board frequency
            standards.

      	  <p>
            Nowadays all global navigational satellite systems use radio
            frequency standards that work in a microwave region. Using state of
            the art optical frequency standards we can transfer them to an optical
            domain, thus increasing the precision.

      	  <p>
            The world best optical frequency standards are based on ytterbium ions,
            aluminium ions, ytterbium atoms, and strontium atoms. The "YBIS"
            project chooses ytterbium ions for the transportable optical clocks.
